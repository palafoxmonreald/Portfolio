## Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

An advanced machine learning model was developed to predict customer churn, leveraging historical data to identify key risk factors. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis to optimize model performance. Multiple algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting, were evaluated to select the most accurate and interpretable model. Additionally, SHAP values were utilized to uncover the primary drivers of churn, providing actionable insights for data-driven retention strategies. This solution enables businesses to proactively identify high-risk customers, optimize engagement efforts, and enhance overall profitability.
